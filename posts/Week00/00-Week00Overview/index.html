This module is designed to be reviewed before class officially starts, so we can hit the ground running in Week 1.</p><p>I'm very excited to introduce you to the world of programming for the iOS ecosystem - including iOS, iPadOS, tvOS (for Apple TV), watchOS (for Apple Watch), visionOS (for Apple Vision Pro), and even macOS (for Macs) - and who knows what else in the future! While we won't dive into some of these specific platforms, you'll learn the basics of iOS development that can applied to more than iPhones!</p><p>In this module, we'll go over some class logistics, including the syllabus, class schedule, and grading criteria; how to properly download and install Xcode; and finally how to run a simple "Hello, World!" program on both a simulator and actual device.</p><p>The material for the modules for this class is presented in several different ways:</p><ul><li>The Website for the class, which is hosted on a GitHub pages site, linked from the Canvas for the course under "Course Content". This website contains what you might find when you go to any of the more popular sites on the web centered around iOS - prose, with embedded videos and code snippets to show you examples of what is being discussed.</li></ul><ul><li>An Examples App - An examples app will be released at the start of the semester in 3 parts, 1 for each section of the course. It contains many of the examples that I will show in class, but in the form of an app you can view on your simulator. This app is provided as a reference you can use throughout the course. If you ever feel lost with how to do something in the class, check this project - it may give you pointers! Sometimes code will be included in Xcode Playgrounds which you can easy edit and rerun to see how your changes impact the results of the code.</li></ul><ul><li>Quizzes - each Wednesday, you'll take a quiz for that week's content. This is to motivate you to read the content early, and use that quiz a checkpoint to make sure you understand the content. You WILL be able to retake the quiz, so use it as a reinforcement tool as you work on understanding the content.</li></ul><ul><li>Homeworks - At the end of each set of lecture material each week (weeks 1-12 only), I'll have you submit a homework that will reinforce the concepts from that week's lecture. I'll sometimes provide starter projects that you can use as the basis of your homework submissions, and your job will be to fill in what the assignment requires. Please note this is NOT YOUR FINAL PROJECT (see below) but simply assessments of how well you understand each week's content. All projects will be done via GitHub Classroom (see "Third Party Tools" later in this week's content).</li></ul><a name="semesterLongProject"></a>
<h2>Semester Long Project</h2><p>Alongside the weekly homeworks, there will be a Semester Long Project that will be of your own making - you'll come up with requirements, sketch out user interfaces, define data flows, and implement your app during the semester! Start thinking about that app NOW, and starting in week 1, you'll start recording those ideas. You and I will come to an agreement on a scaled down version of that "dream app" you have, and that will be your goal for the end of the semester. I'm not expecting it to be able to go right into the App Store - instead, I want it to be of your own design and making, and demonstrate what you have learned in class.</p><a name="getReadyForWeek1"></a>
<h2>Get Ready for Week 1</h2><p>Completing this module, installing the proper software, and making the necessary accounts are all things that should be done <strong><em>before</em></strong> the first day of classes, so you can start learning from day 1. So without further ado...</p><p>Let's get started!</p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../../Week00/01-ClassLogistics/index.html">Class Logistics</A></p><BR/><BR/></div><leftside><u><p>Week 0</p></u><div class="weekSection"><ul><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="tocItem"><a id="Week 00 Overview" href="../../Week00/00-Week00Overview/index.html">Week 00 Overview</a></div><div class="chain chain-bottom"></div></div></li><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="chain chain-top"></div><div class="tocItem"><a id="Class Logistics" href="../../Week00/01-ClassLogistics/index.html">Class Logistics</a></div><div class="chain chain-bottom"></div></div></li><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="chain chain-top"></div><div class="tocItem"><a id="Getting Setup" href="../../Week00/02-GettingSetup/index.html">Getting Setup</a></div><div class="chain chain-bottom"></div></div></li><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="chain chain-top"></div><div class="tocItem"><a id="Hello World" href="../../Week00/03-HelloWorld/index.html">Hello World</a></div><div class="chain chain-bottom"></div></div></li><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="chain chain-top"></div><div class="tocItem"><a id="Third Party Tools" href="../../Week00/04-ThirdPartyTools/index.html">Third Party Tools</a></div></div></li></ul></div></leftside><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2025-2026 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 24, 2026 at 7:54 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
