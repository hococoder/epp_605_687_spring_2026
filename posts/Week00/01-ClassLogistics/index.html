<h2>My contact info</h2><p>My contact information can be found below. My preferred contact method is email at the address you see on screen (rsteele3@jh.edu). I try to respond to all emails within 24 hours, and I usually get to them well before that. In case you need to reach me by phone, you may call me at the number listed on screen between the hours of 9 AM and 9 PM. Please note, however, that I don’t tend to pick up numbers that are unfamiliar to me, so you may have to leave a message; in that case I will get back to you as soon as possible. Another way to reach out, especially for more general questions, is the discussion forums (if used that semester) or Slack. Each of the grading assignments will have a forum, and as long as concepts are discussed (and not implementation – more on that later) the forums/Slack are a great place to get help.</p><img src="../../../week00/contactInfo.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="My Contact Info"/><a name="aboutMe"></a>
<h2>About me</h2><p>Now, a little about me. I’m a Hokie and a Tarheel – I hold a BS in Physics from Virginia Tech, and Masters in Physics from UNC-Chapel Hill, and a MS in Computer Science from Virginia Tech. I’ve been married since 2002 and am a father to 2 sons. I’ve been at APL since 2002, working in the Space Exploration Sector, spending a large part of my time here on MESSENGER, our mission to Mercury, writing planning software in Java. Lately, I've been leading development of the Small Body Mapping Tool, which is also written in Java. I also got the chance to develop and maintain Education and Public outreach iOS apps for both MESSENGER and New Horizons, our mission to Pluto. The picture on the left is me at the MESSENGER impact event, describing the sticker in my hand (it has the name of our last command load to the spacecraft, with “Last MESSENGER Sequence, first Mercury Lithobraking” on it). The right picture is me with my boys at the top of Cadillac Mountain in Maine (a great place to vacation). The picture at the bottom represents my musical side – the Columbia Pro Cantare’s Chamber choir, in which I sang tenor. OK enough about me!</p><img src="../../../week00/PicsOfMe.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Pictures of Me"/><a name="studentInformation"></a>
<h2>Student Information</h2><p>Please be sure the following are up to date in SIS – your email address and your phone number. I will use these methods to contact you in case of matters like bad weather (for in person classes) or when I’m sick, for example. Email is my preferred method – I will put “ACTION” in the subject line when I need your response.</p><a name="gradingInformation"></a>
<h2>Grading Information</h2><h3>Grade Composition</h3><p>Your grade in this course will come from 13 Mid-week quizzes (10%), 12 programming assignments (45%), an App Development Log (15%), and a Final Project (30%). Please see the Course website for more information on each of these areas.</p><ul><li>You will be able to retake quizzes! The quizzes are intended to help reinforce what you are learning that week, so I want that reinforcement to stick!</li><li>Your grade on the programming assignments can either be an A, B, C, or F, with possible +/-.</li><li>Comments and feedback will be provided, but no specific deductions will be spelled out. Specific things to complete will be included in the writeup; if you don't complete those requirements, you'll lose points! Also, don't go wild doing things NOT specified in the assignment writeup - that is a waste of both of our time!</li><li>Each day late will result in a 1 FULL letter grade deduction.</li><li>If you fail to use the Coding Conventions for the class, you will start out with an A- maximum grade.</li><li>Final class grades can be A, B, C, F, or I, with NO +/-, and no curve.</li><li>Do NOT expect an A if you start your assignments a few nights before they are due. I have graded enough last minute assignments to know when you sat down and started working on it. Start early!</li><li>If you are near a grade boundary, your participation in class discussion (slack, forums, even office hours!) MAY help push you over.</li></ul><h3>General Grading Guidelines</h3><p>Here are some general grading guidelines.</p><ul><li>If your project works, includes all required components, is on time, and has good design, you can expect an A.</li><li>Delays in submission, lack of effort, and program execution issues can bring your grade down to a B or C.</li><li>An F will result in cases of plagiarism, being 3 or more days late, showing no apparent effort, or not turning an assignment in.</li></ul><h3>A Note on Programming Assignments</h3><p>When completing programming assignments (this includes the App Development log), all work MUST be your own. You may discuss concepts we have covered, but you MAY NOT discuss implementations. You must also follow coding conventions.</p><h3>Other Grading Guidelines</h3><p>Design, function, style and timeliness all play into your final grade.</p><ul><li>Design<ul><li>Design uses patterns discussed in class properly.</li><li>Design is abstracted effectively.</li><li>Design fits the problem.</li><li>Design for maintenance.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Function<ul><li>Does it work properly?</li><li>Is all required function present?</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Style and Coding Convention<ul><li>Is the code readable?</li><li>Can we figure out what's going on by just reading the code?</li><li>Do you follow coding conventions?</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Timeliness<ul><li>Was it submitted on time?</li><li>1 day late == 1 letter grade deduction.</li><li>2 days late == 2 letter grade deduction.</li><li>3 days late == Grade of F.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Academic Integrity</h3><p>I’m coming back to this concept one more time, because I can’t stress it enough. All work should be your own – you can discuss topics and assignment descriptions, but you cannot work with other students on assignments unless specifically allowed. If, in your research, you find code snippets you wish to use, either from the web or from the class, be sure to attribute your code! Include a link from the web or specify the module in class where you found the code. The last few bullets on this slide are from the “Academic Integrity” portion of the syllabus – please review them!<br><br>Please checkout the new syllabus format on Canvas for full details about this section.</p><h3>Use of Open Source</h3><ul><li>Small sections of code may be copied and used if proper attribution is used, and it is under the proper license.</li><li>For code examples from class, attribute it, specifying the module you found it in.</li><li>Please note that unless stated otherwise, code examples from this class are for this class ONLY and cannot be used for other purposes.</li><li>You may use snippets from Stack Overflow (with attribution).</li><li>You may not use snippets from the Apple Developer forums unless the author explicitly states the code is free to use elsewhere.</li><li>If you find other sources and you aren’t sure if you can use them, please ask.</li></ul><h3>Use of AI Tools</h3><p>The use of any AI tools, including those built into Xcode (which are disabled by default), is explicitly prohibited in this class. You are learning the basics of iOS, and using AI will not help you with that. AI agents such as ChatGPT still spew out a lot of garbage and VERY wrong code, and you don't have the basics in hand to tell the difference between reality and hallucinations. If I find that you have used AI in an assignment, I will fail you for that assignment.<br><br>### Coding Conventions Now, let’s spend a few minutes discussing Coding Conventions. Why should you use them?</p><ul><li>Because we read your code, and that takes time!</li><li>Sometimes your code doesn’t work correctly and we will try to find out why and give partial credit when we can.</li><li>We also have to do this for many students, across many assignments during the semester.</li></ul><p>Here are some of the conventions I’d like you to use.</p><ul><li>Be consistent in your spacing – 4 spaces, or tabs, but not both.</li><li>Class names should be upper camel case, such as “HistoryViewController”.</li><li>Method names should be descriptive – we’ll talk later about how to build method names in Swift, but if you do it right it will be very natural and readable.</li><li>Variable names should be lower camel case.</li><li>Be descriptive – full words should be used where you can, and you should avoid abbreviations (loop indices or standard acronyms are OK).</li><li>In your Xcode project, your organization identifier should read “edu.jhu.ep.lastname.firstname”, and when you name the project, please call it “Lastname_Homework#”, where # is the number of the homework assignment. This helps me keep them in order when I grab them from Canvas to grade.<ul><li>See homework 1 for a video on how to update your Xcode project to reflect your name. Please do this for all assignments.</li></ul></li></ul><a name="discussionParticipation"></a>
<h2>Discussion Participation</h2><p>I have a few strong beliefs in life, and these are at the top of my list.</p><ul><li>“The best way to learn is to teach.”</li><li>“When you are learning something, it is OK to say 'I don’t know'.”</li></ul><p>In the forums/Slack/office hours, ask questions, answer them, make comments, suggest alternative techniques. You may end up helping your classmates in their education, and you may also show me a new way to present an idea I hadn’t thought of before! Also, as mentioned earlier, participation in the forum may make a difference at final grade time.</p><a name="officeHours"></a>
<h2>Office Hours</h2><p>Please see the Canvas site for the office hours for this class. As long as there is one participant, I’ll record the session with Zoom and post the video afterwards. Take advantage of this time to get your question answered! I have had way too many students NOT take advantage of office hours in the past, and their grade suffered because of it! I am here to <em>help you</em> but I can't do it if you don't ask for help! I won't do your assignments for you, but I'm more than happy to point you in the right direction.</p><a name="weeklySchedule"></a>
<h2>Weekly Schedule</h2><p>The weekly schedule for this semester is located under the Course Content portion of the Canvas website, as well as the Calendar section. Please note each week is comprised of several submodules, and many have a dependence on submodules earlier in the semester. Also note the due dates for the assignments on the weekly schedule. All assignments are due at 11:59:59 PM Eastern time on the day they are due. The week is considered Monday 00:00:00 to Sunday 23:59:59 Eastern time each week.</p><a name="slack"></a>
<h2>Slack</h2><p>I have a Slack setup for class discussions. Use the invite below:</p><p>The Slack Channel invite (join the #605-687-Spring-2026 channel): <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/hococoder/shared_invite/zt-2poq6u3es-UVa~LRjLwY1rDS3BgWydvg">Join us on Slack!</a></p><p>Please keep this private and only use it for this class!
