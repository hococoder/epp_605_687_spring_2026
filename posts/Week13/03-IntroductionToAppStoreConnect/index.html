<h2>Overview</h2><p><a href="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com">https://appstoreconnect.apple.com</a> is where you go to get your app ready for the app store, check out sales, get tax and financial reports, and define your users and roles. App Store Connect is only available with paid developer accounts.</p><h3>Defining Information for you Apps</h3><p>Here’s a few screenshots for a few of the apps that APL had in the store - New Horizons and MESSENGER. You can see the version number, their current review status (for example, in review, or ready for sale) along with information such as the app name, price, and the price schedule (you can schedule sales, for example).</p><img src="../../../week13/Apps.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Apps in Testflight"/><p>Under the iOS app section, you can setup specific metadata for your app, such as app previews and screenshots. Recent improvements allow you to just submit screenshots for the largest device (for example, the iPhone Plus variants) and Apple will rescale them for the other size devices. You can also add information for promotional text, keywords, a description, and various URLs for support and marketing. If your app has an iMessage app or Apple Watch app you can add information for those here, and see the current build from Xcode that is currently assigned to this app. Other information like the app icon, copyright, and contact information can also be added. If you include In App Purchases in your app, you can add those here, and you can let the reviewer know any information they may need during the review, including test user login information if applicable. Finally, you can decide whether you want iTunes Connect to automatically release your app store, release it on a given date, or release it manually.</p><h3>App Features</h3><p>Apps can also have features that can be managed from iTunes Connect.</p><ul><li>In app purchases are setup here, and associated with your app. If your app is a game, you can add your app to game center, setup leaderboards, and setup Achievements.</li><li>You can also setup promo codes, which are one time use codes that you can give out so people can try your app for free. These come in handy when you want a website to review your app.</li></ul><img src="../../../week13/PromoCodes.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Promo Codes"/><h3>Testing Your Apps</h3><p>See the next section, TestFlight, to learn all about beta testing your app!</p><h3>Activity</h3><p>Under the activity tab, you can see a history of builds that have been submitted for iOS, all apps that are applicable for the App Store, and their status. You can also see the app ratings and reviews in iTunes Connect, which was mentioned back when we talked about getting user feedback.</p><h3>Analytics</h3><p>You may go through many iterations of you app over time, and iTunes Connect gives you a history of all of the builds, when they were uploaded, and what their external and app store testing status is.</p><img src="../../../week13/BuildHistory.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Build History"/><p>iTunes Connect also provides a rich set of analytics that you can use to determine how your app is doing in terms of downloads and sales. You can see how many people have viewed your app’s page on the app store, how many people have downloaded the app, the number of In App Purchases, how many crashes over time, the number of active devices, where in the world your users are, as well as the number of paying users. These analytics can be seen over various spans of time, which allows you to see how different events like sales have impacted your sales.</p><img src="../../../week13/AppAnalytics.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="App Analytics"/><p>One more analytic to point out - and that’s retention. This can give you a metric describing how many people come back to your app in the days after they installed it. This is a great way to see if you app engagement ideas are working as intended!</p><p>In additional to straight numbers, you can also get a trend chart, which lets you see how the download and purchases activity of your app varies over time.</p><img src="../../../week13/SalesTrend.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Sales Trends"/><p>Here’s some other things you can from iTunes Connect.</p><ul><li>You can view payments and financial reports which covers reported earnings, payments, and the amount owed to you (remember, Apple gets a 30% cut (now 15% as of Jan 2021!).</li><li>Users and roles allow you to invite people to your team and assign them to certain roles, as well as setup your TestFlight testers.</li><li>You can also setup your tax information, and review the agreements for banking and tax information.</li><li>Finally you can get resources and help on app development, in addition to deploying other items such as books and media.</li></ul><h3>Getting Ready to Deploy</h3><p>When you’re ready to deploy your app, make sure that all of your metadata is in place, including screenshots and icons where needed. If you need to provide a sample account so the beta tester can test properly, be sure to provide that. And make sure you’ve tested, ON DEVICE, as much as you can. Once you’re ready, hit the submit button, and wait for the reviewer to get back to you. Currently it takes 1-2 days, and depending on the settings in your app, once it passes review, the app can deploy immediately, at a particular date, or whenever you want by choosing the manual option.</p><p>App Store Connect is the final stop for your app and its associated metadata before it goes out the store, and is your portal to analytics and payment information as your app becomes the next big star on the store.</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../../Week13/02-IntroductionToTheDeveloperPortal/index.html">Introduction to the Developer Portal</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../../Week13/04-Testflight/index.html">TestFlight</A></p><BR/><BR/></div><leftsideempty></leftsideempty><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2025-2026 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 19, 2026 at 4:09 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
