<h2>Overview</h2><p>OK, let's take a few minutes to go over some tips and tricks in Xcode that will help you in the weeks to come.</p><a name="theLeftPane"></a>
<h2>The left pane</h2><center><iframe id="myIframe" src="https://jh.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=b6b293ea-864d-4b04-b897-b3d401657bf4&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all"  style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" aria-label="Panopto Embedded Video Player" aria-description="Week0-04-THIRDPARTYTOOLS-Lecture" ></iframe></center><p>Let's touch on a few of the sections of the left pane of Xcode.</p><h3>Project Navigator</h3><p>On the left hand side is the navigator. If you don't see the navigator, go to the series of the buttons in the upper right hand corner of the interface and enable the navigator.</p><p>There are several tabs under the navigator, the first of which is the Project Navigator. This shows the project hierarchy, starting with your project file. This file is important because you can change things like build configurations, capabilities, and other metadata for your app from here. This file also lets you add new targets, like a watch app, for example.</p><p>Under that project file is a series of folders containing your source code, resources, including the Asset catalog (where you can store images) and any database model files you may make.</p><h3>Source Control Navigator</h3><p>The next tab over is the source control navigator. While commits, pushes and pulls are handled via the Source Control menu, this tab shows you your branches, tags, stashes and remotes for your repository. You can make new branches or tags from here, as well as handle merges.</p><h3>Issue Navigator</h3><p>The fifth tab over, the one that looks like a triangle with an exclamation in it, is the issues navigator. Here you will get a list of warnings and errors when you build your project, and from here you can click on those warnings and errors to visit the source code where the problem took place. Be sure to take heed of the warnings here, in addition to the errors - there are sometimes varying degrees of "warning", some of which may be blocking you from getting the result you want.</p><h3>Test Navigator</h3><p>On the sixth tab, you'll find the test navigator. Here, you'll see the list of tests that are available for your app, and you can run individual tests of sets of tests. You'll also see the results of the tests very quickly with a stoplight coding system - red you fail, green you pass.</p><h3>Debug Navigator</h3><p>The seventh and final tab we'll discuss here is the Debug Navigator. Here, you can get a quick look at the CPU, memory, disk and network usage of your app. along with any other debug information you may get from establishing breakpoints in your code.</p><p>In the next video, we'll look at the center area of the UI - the editor.</p><a name="editorPreviewCanvasMultipleEditors"></a>
<h2>Editor, Preview Canvas, Multiple Editors</h2><center><iframe id="myIframe" src="https://jh.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=863f3375-3aaa-4535-8111-b3d401657bf7&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all"  style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" aria-label="Panopto Embedded Video Player" aria-description="Week0-04-THIRDPARTYTOOLS-Lecture" ></iframe></center><h3>Helper views - Minimap, Preview Canvas and Multiple Previews</h3><p>Let's take a look at the center of the Xcode user interface - the editor. As you can guess, this is where you'll edit your source files, but depending on what kind of file you're looking at, the editor can take on some other traits. For example, as you've seen, if you open up a SwiftUI file, the preview canvas shows up on the right hand side of the editor, while the source code file takes up the left side.</p><p>You may have also noticed that the source code editor can also have what's called a minimap beside it - giving you a condensed view of your overall file. Certain commented code - those denoted with //MARK: for example, get their text enlarged in the mini map so you can see the different sections of your code.</p><p>By the way, if you don't for some reason see the minimap or preview canvas, you can enable them by clicking on the "Adjust Editor Options" button in the upper right hand corner of the editor.</p><h3>Additional Editors</h3><p>Speaking of that region of the screen, the button just to the right of that lets you add an editor to the right of the current one (and if you hold down option while clicking it, it will switch to add editor below). This way you can have 2 source files side by side. Another shortcut to get a source file in a new editor is to hold down the option key while clicking the file in the project navigator.</p><h3>Jump Bar</h3><p>One last thing to look at here is the very top of the editor - the jump bar. This tool not only lets you jump to different files in your project file hierarchy, but also jump to different declared properties, methods and even sections (denoted with syntax like the //MARK comment), which can come in handy with large files.</p><a name="theRightPaneAndTheConsole"></a>
<h2>The Right pane and the Console</h2><center><iframe id="myIframe" src="https://jh.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=53cf9183-a7a0-4eb8-91cd-b3d401659368&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all"  style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" aria-label="Panopto Embedded Video Player" aria-description="Week0-04-THIRDPARTYTOOLS-Lecture" ></iframe></center><p>If they aren't open already, there are 2 other panes you can open in Xcode via that series of buttons in the upper right hand corner - the debug area and the inspectors. The middle one reveals the debug area</p><h3>Debug Pane</h3><p>The debug pane is split into 2 different panes - the variables view and the console (if you don't see both of <em>those</em>, do to the lower right of the debug pane and turn them both on. The variables pane shows you the state of variables during debug, while the right hand side, which you'll probably use most often, is the console where logging messages - both from you and the system - will appear.</p><h3>File Inspector</h3><p>The inspectors panel has at least 3 subtabs, depending on the type of file. The first is always the file inspector, which gives you information about the file you have selected, including which targets that file belongs to, and if applicable what localizations are available for this file.</p><h3>History Inspector</h3><p>The history inspector in the next tab shows you the history of that file in version control. Useful for knowing at a quick glance who introduced that pesky bug you just found.</p><h3>Help Inspector</h3><p>The help inspector in the next tab will present documentation for the currently selected item in the editor - this includes not only code from Swift but third party libraries and your own code (provided you have written the documentation)</p><h3>The Attributes Inspector</h3><p>SwiftUI files will show some of their attributes in the Attributes Inspector, the final possible tab on this pane. The attributes shown here are also ones you can change in code.</p><h3>Much more</h3><p>There's more in the Xcode UI, and we'll touch on some of those in later modules throughout the semester.
